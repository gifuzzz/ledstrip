# ledstrip

I made this to control my aoguerbe led strip lights from internet.
I only used this with a Raspberry Pi, but bluepy should run on x86 Debian Linux.

## Usage

Create a file called `config.py` and change the bluetooth mac address to the one of your lights, then run `server.py` and all should work
